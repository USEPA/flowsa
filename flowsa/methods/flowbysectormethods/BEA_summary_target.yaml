# This file can be used to set up target NAICS for a summary level model
# NAICS are targeted to enable 1:1 correspondence between NAICS and BEA
# Summary sectors

# To use in a FBS method add
# !include:BEA_summary_target.yaml
# to the top of the method replacing the three parameters below

industry_spec:
  default: NAICS_3
  NAICS_4: ['336', '541']
# Note 531, 532, 533, and 92* are not resolved at the 3 digit NAICS
# but they do not resolve at higher resolution and so using 3-digit NAICS
# is sufficient
