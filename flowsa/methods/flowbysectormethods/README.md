  clean up/modify the FBA data prior to allocating data to sectors. 
  Function is called using the `!script_function:` tag.
- _clean_fba_w_sec_df_fxn_: (optional) calls on function in the source.py 
  file to clean up/modify the FBA dataframe, after sector columns are added 
  but prior to allocating data to sectors. Function is called using

  name of mapping file for Material Flow List.

### Activity set specifications
- _activity_sets_: A subset of the FBA dataset and the method and 
  allocation datasets used to create an FBS
- _names_: (list) specify the subset of the FBA to allocate based on values in the
   Activity Produced/Consumed By fields. To use an external activity set .
  csv file, use the tag `!from_index:file_name.csv`, then give the name (e.g., 
  `activity_set_1`) of the activity set as found in the csv file.
- _source_flows_: (list, optional) specify the 'FlowName'(s) from the FBA 
   to use. If not provided, all flows are used.
- _allocation_method_: currently written for 'direct', 
   'allocation_function', 'proportional', and 'proportional-flagged'. See 
  descriptions below.
- _allocation_source_: The primary data source used to allocate main FBA for
   specified activity to sectors
- _literature_sources_: (optional) Specific functions that contain values 
  from literature used to modify FBA data. 
- _activity_to_sector_mapping_: (optional) name of activity to sector 
  mapping file, if not provided will use the source name
- _allocation_source_class_: specific 'FlowClass' found in the allocation 
  source flowbyactivity parquet
- _allocation_source_year_: specific to the allocation datasets, use the 
  year relevant to the main FBA dataframe
- _allocation_flow_: (list) the relevant 'FlowName' values, as found in the 
  source flowbyactivity parquet. Use 'None' to capture all flows.
- _allocation_compartment_: (list) the relevant 'Compartment' values, as 
  found in the source flowbyactivity parquet. Use 'None' to capture all 
  compartments.
- _allocation_from_scale_: national, state, or county - dependent on 
  allocation source, as not every level exits for sources
- _allocation_fba_load_scale_: (optional) Can indicate geographic level of 
  FBA to load, helpful when an FBA ia large
- _clean_allocation_fba_: (optional) Function to clean up the allocation 
  FBA, as defined in the source.py file. Function is called using 
  the`!script_function:` tag.
- _clean_allocation_fba_w_sec_: (optional) Function to clean up the 
  allocation FBA, after allocation activities are assigned SectorProducedBy 
  and SectorConsumedBy columns. Function is called using 
  the`!script_function:` tag.
- _allocation_map_to_flow_list_: (optional) If the allocation df and source 
  df need to be matched on Context and/or Flowable, set to 'True'
- _helper_source_: (optional) secondary df for sector allocation
- _helper_method_: currently written for 'multiplication', 'proportional', 
  and 'proportional-flagged'
- _helper_activity_to_sector_mapping_: (optional) name of activity to 
  sector mapping file, if not provided will use the source name
- _helper_source_class_: specific 'FlowClass' found in the allocation 
  source flowbyactivity parquet
- _helper_source_year_: specific to the allocation datasets, use the year 
  relevant to the main FBA dataframe
- _helper_flow_: (list) the relevant 'FlowName' values, as found in the 
  source flowbyactivity parquet
- _helper_from_scale_: national, state, or county - dependent on allocation 
  source, as not every level exits for sources
- _clean_helper_fba_: (optional) Function to clean up the helper FBA. 
  Function is called using the`!script_function:` tag.
- _clean_helper_fba_wsec_: (optional) Function to clean up the helper FBA, 
  after allocation activities are assigned SectorProducedBy and 
  SectorConsumedBy columns. Function is called using 
  the`!script_function:` tag.

### Source specifications (in FBS format)
If source data format is specified as 'FBS':
- _source_names_: The name of the FBS dataset
- _data_format_: 'FBS', loads a FlowBySector
- _year_: year of available dataset (ex. 2015)
- _clean_fbs_df_fxn_: (optional) apply function to clean the FBS after it 
  is accessed. Function is called using the`!script_function:` tag.

### FBS_outside_flows specifications
If source data_format is specified as `FBS_outside_flowsa`:
- _FBS_datapull_fxn_: name of the function to generate the FBS. Function is 
  called using the`!script_function:` tag.
- _parameters_: (list) parameters to pass into the function

## Method Descriptions
- allocation_function: Activities are assigned to sectors using a specified 
  function
- direct: Activities are directly assigned to sectors using the source to 
  NAICS crosswalk
- multiplication: Multiply the values in the allocation data source with 
  values sharing the same sectors in the helper allocation data source
- proportional: Activities are proportionally allocated to sectors using 
  specified allocation data source
- proportional-flagged: Activities that are flagged (assigned a value of 
  '1') are proportionally allocated to sectors using a specified allocation 
  data source. Activities that are not flagged (assigned a value of '0') 
  are directly assigned to sectors.
