# Source Catalog
The 'source_catalog.yaml' file should be manually updated with each new
Flow-By-Activity.

## Term descriptions
- _class_: list, classes such as "Water" found in the Flow-By-Activity
- _sector-like_activities_: 'True' or 'False', “sector-like activities” are 
  True when the Flow-By-Activity “ActivityProducedBy” and 
  “ActivityConsumedBy” columns are already NAICS based. For example, all 
  BLS QCEW data for employment and establishments are published by NAICS 
  codes. We deem these “sector-like” because we then implement checks to 
  determine if the activities are published in the identified NAICS year in the
  Flow-By-Sector and if not, we have a crosswalk to map the sectors/NAICS 
  to NAICS year. 
- _activity_schema_: 'None' if 'sector-like_activities' is False, otherwise 
  the year of the sector data
  (ex. NAICS_2012_Code)
- _sector_aggregation_level_: 'aggregated' or 'disaggregated'. Some dataset 
  crosswalks contain every level of relevant sectors (ex. NAICS for 2-6 
  digits), that is they are fully disaggregated. Other datasets only 
  contain information for the highest relevant sector level, in which case, 
  the dataset is marked as showing aggregated sectors only (e.g., 
  USGS_WU_Coef crosswalk).
